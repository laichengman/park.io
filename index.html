<h1>Fort Canning Park</h1>
<p>Fort Canning Park is an iconic hilltop landmark that has <b>witnessed many of Singapore’s historical milestones</b>. </p>

<img src="fortcanningparkfront.jpg" alt="Fort Canning Park" style="width:450px;height:300px;">

<p>Did you know that the hill was once called the fobidden hill? That is because the hill once sited the <b>palaces of 14th century Kings</b>. It also served as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on <b>15 February 1942</b> was also made on the hill, in the Underground Far East Command Centre, commonly known as Battle Box.</p>
<p>Today, Fort Canning Park features nine historical gardens - the Pancur Larangan, Artisan’s Garden, Sang Nila Utama Garden, Jubilee Park, Raffles Garden, First Botanic Garden, Farquhar Garden, Spice Garden and Armenian Street Park.</p>

<h2 id="C1">What to see</h2>
<p> Do you think it is possible to plan for a trail that covers all nine gardens? It will take a long time. Let me tell you more about my top 3 gardens so you can plan for yourself to see these "must-see" gardens. </p>

<h3>No.3 Artisan's garden</h3>
<img src="artisansgarden.jpg" alt="Artisan's garden" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
<p>How do you know whether Singapore had a history before Raffles came? There are few written records. However, the land we step on does not lie. Here at Artisan's garden, you can find out more about how and what archaeologist discovered during their "digging journey". </p>

<img src="greenware.jpg" alt="Greenware" style="width:300px;height:300px;">
<p>For example, this greenware shows that there was trade in Singapore back in the <b>14th century</b>, way before Raffles step foot in Singapore. </p>

<h3>No.2 Raffles garden</h3>
<img src="rafflesgardenfront.jpg" alt="Raffles Garden" style="width:450px;height:300px;">  <img src="rafflesgardenback.jpg" alt="Raffles Garden" style="width:450px;height:300px;">
<p>This garden is named after Sir Stamford Raffles (1781–1826), the founder of modern Singapore. Whilst Raffles is most remembered for his public life in the former British colonies in Southeast Asia, he was also an avid naturalist, who spent his free time studying botany and wildlife.</p>
<p>Inspired by his love for plants, the Raffles Garden showcases the diverse plant species that Raffles encountered in Southeast Asia. It includes species collected, studied or planted by Raffles and his fellow naturalists, some of whom were also his closest friends. </p>

<h3>No.1 Sang Nila Utama garden</h3>
<p>The Sang Nila Utama Garden is named after the first ancient king of Singapore and reimagines the Southeast Asian gardens of old. Such gardens were integral parts of palaces such as the one which stood on this hill in the 14th century. </p>
<img src="sangnilautamagarden.jpg" alt="Sang Nila Utama Garden" style="width:300px;height:450px;"> 
<p>The garden has traditional features such as a symmetrical layout typical of these spaces, a series of Javanese split gates that mark the entrance of new zones/’realms’, and a reflective pool which can serve as a meditative refuge.</p>
<p>It is a garden with very special contruction that you will not find elsewhere in Singapore.Click <a href="https://walkingsingapore.com/sang-nila-utama-garden-at-fort-canning-park-a-journey-to-bali/">here</a> to find out more!</p>

<h2 id="C2">How to go</h2>
<p> There are different ways to enter this park. However, the difficulty of the journey round the park would depends on the enterance you choose. Let me share the 3 MRT entrances and their pros and cons.</p>

<h3>No.2 Alight at Fort Canning Station (Exit B).</h3>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Near the only food place:Tiong Bahru Bakery</td>
    <td>Far from most of the gardens</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Near the kids playground</td>
    <td>Station is at the foot of the hill</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>No.1 Alight at Dhoby Ghaut Station (Exit B)</h3>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Middle point of the hill</td>
    <td>Far from food</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Near the iconic Tree Tunnel for photo</td>
    <td>Far from the kids playground</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Near the battlebox museum</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Personally, I would recommend coming in from Dhoby Ghaut station if you are planning to visit the whole park. It is less tiring since it is a mix of uphills and downhills. By the time you are tired and hungry, you can head down to the Foothill to visit the Tiong Bahru Bakery for food!</p>

<h2 id="C3">Tips and tricks</h2>
<p> Some tips from my experience visiting the park:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring water! Lots of walking are completed under the sun, do bring enough water to stay hydrated! </li>
<li>Bring umbrella! Singapore's weather is difficult to predict. The park is located on a hill, if it pours, it will be difficult to get out of the park. If it does rain, please head out of the park as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Bring some snacks with you! There is no restaurants on the hill, so do prepare some snacks in case you get too hungry to complete your trail. Please do remember to dispose your trash properly.  </li>
